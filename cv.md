##  About Myself:

In early 2024, I made the decision to transition from the solar panel industry to pursue a career in software development. This led me to enroll at 42School Prague, where I am currently honing my skills. My primary interest lies in frontend development, which prompted me to simultaneously study frontend technologies at RS School. I am hope to become a Junior Frontend Developer by 2025.
